# MX_HHKB
Mechanical keyboard based on HHKB layout

## About

Just another fun(?) keyboard with HHKB layout. Designed to fit in some 60% Poker cases.

Can accept normal caps lock or stepped. No Backlight or RGB leds, just 2 leds on Caps lock and Esc.

All caps are in standard size to increase choice of keysets!
